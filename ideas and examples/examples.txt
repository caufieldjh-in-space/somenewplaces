A constantly-changing noir city with Art Deco and Japanese elements. It's actually a virtual world.
A smog-choked hellscape built into the side of a giant rabbit's foot.
A castle built out of foam. The residents are colorful and feathered.

Eventual goal:
Place types will determine some of the aspects in play, e.g. a dystopia gets something like "It's ruled by narcoleptic fanatics." and a castle gets "The towers have a peculiar smell." 

This shouldn't just be about visual aesthetics and settings, though.
It's also about what happens in these places.
That's going to be the complicated part.

Major next goal:
Use Wikipedia (and potentially other sources?) to expand these settings
into full-fledged...um...just prose for now. Not full stories yet.
This may put it outside the realm of a Twitter bot but that's fine.
The idea is to use the setting as the nucleus of a very short, 
generated story.
